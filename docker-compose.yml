    # This service is technically the same as the builder service, only this one
    # has no volume mounted to the working directory. This causes the files to
    # be used (for example installed dependencies) that are created _inside_ the
    # container to be used, rather than having to set them up in the working
    # directory, during GitHub Actions for example.
